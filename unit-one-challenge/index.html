              <p>In this complicated relationship between Art and Maths. At this moment my Maths is Programming.
                Would you like to know which one I chose between the three? I couldn't choose one, it's unfair 
                of me. So I chose both. I draw whenever I can and work on designing websites and mobile apps to 
                add to my portfolio and eventually turn it into a fully functional digital company. I do 
                UX Design and Illustration designs of my drawings. Then once I'm done with all of that in my 
                spare time, I place my nerd hat on and actually program it all into a fully functional webpage 
                or mobile app. <b>Don't believe me, have a look at it <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces/" target="_blank">here</a> </b></p><!-- Get real codespace Github link-->
